# ANALYSIS


- Infected  windows Client


To identify the IP of the infected windows client we filter  "http" traffic to identify any unencrypted traffic and what the contents of the traffic are

It seems there is alot of traffic comming from  10.2.28.88

Checking the type of traffic coming from it we see its sending some POST request to "http://45.131.214.85/fakeurl.htm" which could be possible data leaks

IP: 10.2.28.88

- MAC Address of the infected windows host


Now that we have the IP of the Infected Windows Host,we need to identify its Mac address which we do so by filtering with its ip address "ip.addr == 10.2.28.88 "

Mac addr:00:19:d1:b2:4d:ad

- User Account Name

To identify the user account name we need to user Kerberos traffic to identify any username  used for ticket granting,we use the filter "kerberos.CNameString"

Kerberos Traffic

We idetify the CNameString as "brolf" which our client user's account name

- brolf

- Full Username of the user 

Here i used Packet Find option and some port filtering which led me to port "tcp.port == 59988" and in tcp.stream eq 9 i found the full username of the user as
